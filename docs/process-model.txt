The software process model that would most accurately describe our project would be AGILE. After almost every 448 class, our team would meet at the Roasterie to discuss what we were trying to implement, what we needed to implement, and general scheduling for the development cycle. We have a Trello board with to-dos and post-it boards. We also met at McLain's in addition to the after-class meetings to discuss futher what we needed to do. During the last week of the project, we also had several hours-long coding sessions at Anschutz Library. Between the meetings, often only a few functions would be implemented. In addition, we had divided our team into two sub-teams, Front-End and Back-End, which collaborated to decide how the website we set up and the back-end we set up would would together. This meeting often and collaboration between two sub-teams, leading to iterative building of our application, is very close to the definition of AGILE development.
